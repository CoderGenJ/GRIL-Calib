# GRIL-Calib
Official implementation of our paper **"GRIL-Calib: Targetless Ground Robot IMU-LiDAR Extrinsic Calibration Method using Ground Plane Motion Constraints"**.  

## About GRIL-Calib
<p align="center"><img src="./figs/GRIL-Calib-overview.png" width = "500" ></p>  

- **GRIL-Calib** is the LiDAR-IMU calibration method for ground robots.
- Using only **planar motion**, the 6-DOF calibration parameter could be estimated.

## Codes  
Our paper is currently under review. Our code will be released once the paper is accepted.
